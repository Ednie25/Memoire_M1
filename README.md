# Impact of Public Energy Transition Policies on the Profitability of the Transport Sector in Île-de-France
Introduction
In the 1990s, Western nations grew increasingly concerned about air pollution resulting from industrialization. Despite recognizing its harmful effects, G20 countries struggled to agree on effective measures due to conflicting interests. Europe, however, has gradually implemented ambitious climate change plans, focusing on precautionary measures, correcting environmental damage, and the polluter-pays principle. France has enacted extensive legislation to fight air pollution, emphasizing a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Île-de-France plans to replace its entire bus fleet with electric buses by 2025.
