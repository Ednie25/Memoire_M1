# Impact of Public Energy Transition Policies on the Profitability of the Transport Sector in Île-de-France

In the 1990s, Western nations grew increasingly concerned about air pollution resulting from industrialization. Despite recognizing its harmful effects, G20 countries struggled to agree on effective measures due to conflicting interests. Europe, however, has gradually implemented ambitious climate change plans, focusing on precautionary measures, correcting environmental damage, and the polluter-pays principle. France has enacted extensive legislation to fight air pollution, emphasizing a transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Île-de-France plans to replace its entire bus fleet with electric buses by 2025.

## Objective

This repository examines the economic impact of public energy transition policies on the public transport sector in Île-de-France from 2000 to 2019. The study uses econometric modeling to analyze short-term and long-term effects on profitability and explores potential solutions for sustaining the sector amid the energy transition.

## Key Findings

- **Short-term Impact:** The econometric modeling revealed a significant short-term negative impact of investments on profitability.
- **Long-term Impact:** A minimal long-term positive impact was observed, suggesting that the positive effects of investments are not sufficient to ensure sustainability.
- **/Recommendations:** The study suggests that opening Île-de-France's public transport networks to competition, as prescribed by European and national legislation, could help sustain the sector amid the energy transition, given that public funds alone may not be sufficient.


## Repository Structure
- **investissement:** Data related to investments made in the context of the study. 
- **rentabilité:** Data related to profitability analysis.
- **concoursPublics:** Data related to public funds. 
- **database1:**  Contains raw or initial datasets used in the analysis.
- **databaseFinale:** Contains datasets that have been processed, cleaned, and prepared for analysis. These datasets are ready for use in the models or analyses conducted in the project.
